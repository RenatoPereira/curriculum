                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Senior Front-end Developer with over 10 years of experience, all in remote work, specializing in crafting high-performance user interfaces with a strong focus on user experience. I possess advanced knowledge of JavaScript, React, CSS, and Next.js, demonstrated through impactful projects at scale. Throughout my remote career, I've honed my ability to work autonomously and effectively within distributed teams, both large and small, while maintaining excellent asynchronous communication.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In my most recent role, I spearheaded the complete restructuring of the online payment system for a fintech valued at over $1 billion. The project encompassed the unification of two systems into a monorepo, the integration of a third, complex payment system (including an e-commerce platform), and the optimization of the architecture for enhanced security, development velocity, and reliability.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Previously, I developed an HTML and JavaScript application for smart TVs for Brazil's largest streaming platform. I successfully optimized performance for low-end devices, creating a unified solution with animations that ran flawlessly across varying hardware specifications.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am currently seeking new challenges in an international and remote environment, where I can leverage my expertise and passion for web development to contribute to innovative projects.

                    <p class="role">Senior Front-end Developer</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Led the complete refactoring of the company's non-present card application, transforming it into a monorepo using Next.js 14 to optimize performance and maintainability.
                            <br />
                            Implemented advanced state management using the XState library to ensure system robustness and scalability.
                            <br />
                            Established a shared codebase among three distinct systems, fostering code reusability and consistency across the platform.
                            <br />
                            Successfully overcame the challenge of transforming the application into a secure and efficient monorepo for a payments institution by implementing best security practices and an intuitive continuous deployment pipeline.

                            <strong>Achievement:</strong> Delivered the fully functional application to three distinct systems, utilizing a unified core for the payment process, resulting in a successful deployment with no errors and an immediate 15% increase in approval rates. Application stability also prevented estimated losses of R$2 million for every 30 minutes of inactivity in the "payment link" system.
                            <br />
                            Ensured the implementation and sharing of the redesign across all three applications, enhancing the user experience consistently.
