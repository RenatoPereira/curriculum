        <div class="experience-item">
          <h4>Cloudwalk, Inc. (Oct 2023 - Dec 2024)</h4>
          <p class="role">Software Engineer III</p>

          <p>
            Responsible for the maintenance and implementation of
            card-not-present products. Also responsible for mentoring other
            developers on the team.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created the user interface for the online catalog, which was
              integrated with the payment system. This was developed using
              Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Xstate, with the payment library being
              shared among the different systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactored the user interface of the billing payment system using
              Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Xstate, and shared the payment library
              across systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactored the user interface of the payment link system using
              Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Xstate, while sharing the payment
              library across systems. This increased the approval rate by up to
              15% for a system processing approximately 30 million Brazilian
              Reals in daily transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented Apple Pay and Google Pay in a single shared component,
              delivering it to three distinct systems simultaneously. This
              tripled the delivery speed of the new functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactored the company's web user account and implemented new
              functionalities using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Reducing a
              considerable quantity of code by applying componentization and
              code reuse, increasing the maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provided mentorship to junior developers and oversaw the
              implementation of best practices.

          <h4>Stormx (Mar 2022 - Oct 2023)</h4>
          <p class="role">Senior Front-end Software Engineer</p>

          <p>
            Responsible for maintaining and implementing new features in the
            desktop application for simultaneously animating multiple ads. I
            also created a new application for batch asset approval and
            delivery. Furthermore, I mentored other developers on the team.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed a feature for export Adsense in batch, enabling content
              modification based on table data and real time view/modification.
              This innovation allowed for the delivery of dozens of assets by
              simply using a single animation template configured with all
              required resolutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refactored the renderer in Javascript to enable the platform to
              generate and deliver text and image assets directly, rather than
              solely relying on PSD file exports.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced the application's performance through the implementation
              of ReactJS best practices, data memoization, and optimized CSS
              animations. This led to the team being able to utilize machines
              with 50% less processing power than before.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed and implemented the functionality for dynamic asset
              visualization updates directly within the platform, along with the
              ability to update individual assets independently, eliminating the
              need for an external platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed an online platform for viewing, reviewing, approving,
              and delivering assets in batch to clients, built with Next.js,
              Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and the Google Drive API.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintained simultaneous and direct communication with various
              teams to propose application enhancements.
            </li>

          <p class="role">Senior Front-end Software Engineer</p>

          <p>
            Responsible for the maintenance and implementation of new
            functionalities for the smart TV application using React.js and
            module CSS. Responsible for the implementation of the new smart TV
            application with a transpiler for web and native code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implemented the new user state management across screens, removing
              the screen stack. This functionality reduced the complexity of
              managing routes and screens from two separate codebases for
              low-end and high-end devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with others team to improve player performance, by
              preventing the rendering and synchronization of off-screen
              components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented offline fallback capabilities and enhancements for
              application navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented a Proof of Concept (POC) to unify all low-end and
              high-end code into a single codebase, removing low-end limitations
              such as rounded borders, shadow usage, and animations. From this
              POC, a team was created, which I joined, for the research and
              development of a new application that compiles from a single
              codebase for both web and native platforms.
